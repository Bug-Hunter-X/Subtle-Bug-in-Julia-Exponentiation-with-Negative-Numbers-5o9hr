# Julia Exponentiation Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Julia code involving exponentiation with negative numbers. The original code uses the `^` operator, which doesn't correctly handle negative bases raised to non-integer powers. This can lead to unexpected results or errors.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.jl` file shows how to correct the issue using the `^` operator with careful consideration of the base or using `pow` for complex cases.

This example highlights the importance of understanding the behavior of mathematical operators in different programming languages and choosing the appropriate function for reliable computation.
